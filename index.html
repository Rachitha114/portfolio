            <h3>Online Flower Shop</h3>
            <p>As a frontend developer passionate about creating delightful user experiences, I embarked on the journey of crafting an online flower shop project from scratch. Leveraging the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I meticulously designed and developed a seamless and intuitive platform for users to explore, select, and purchase their favorite blooms.</p>
            <p> With a keen eye for detail, I crafted visually stunning layouts using CSS to ensure an engaging and visually appealing experience.JavaScript was instrumental in adding interactivity and functionality to the project. From dynamic product listings and interactive image galleries to intuitive checkout processes</p>
